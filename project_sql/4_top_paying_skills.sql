Key Takeaways:
    Cloud specialization (BigQuery, GCP, Looker) and big data tools (Airflow, Spark, Hadoop) offer the highest salaries.
    Python and SQL are essential but donâ€™t guarantee top earnings on their own.
    Excel and PowerPoint remain useful but are not high-paying skills.
    Legal compliance (GDPR) and office tools (SAP, PowerPoint) have the lowest salaries.
To maximize earnings, focus on big data, cloud (GCP, BigQuery), data engineering (Airflow, Spark, Hadoop), and BI (Tableau, Looker).
